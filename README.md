# website-infrastructure
IaaS code for hosting a simple website on AWS using Terraform and Docker.

You'll need an AWS account (https://aws.amazon.com) and you'll need terraform (https://www.terraform.io/) installed before playing with this.

When you're ready, just replace the URL in the user_data section of main.tf with a git repo holding any static web site.
